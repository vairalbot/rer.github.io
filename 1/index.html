                "As the moon graces the sky with its gentle glow, I want to wish you a serene good night, beautiful. 
                Your presence in my day has been a source of joy and warmth, and as you embrace the realm of dreams, 
                know that you carry the radiance of a thousand stars. May the night unfold peacefully around you, 
                cradling you in its comforting embrace. Sleep well, beautiful, and may tomorrow bring you even more 
                reasons to smile. Sweet dreams ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•."
